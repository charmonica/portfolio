                <h2>Hey! I'm Chrissy.</h2>
                <p>An unrepentant nerd based in Newark, DE but who considers the Greater Philadelphia region to be home. I'm an enthusiastic student and creator of code, voraciously consuming everything I can learn after accidentally obtaining a humanities degree.</p>

                <h2>Want to know more?</h2>
                <p>At my core, I'm just a weird kid who has always enjoyed working collaboratively as part of a team. I spent my undergraduate career at Widener University as a member of a wide variety of causes and organizations, and spent time serving as president and vice president of organizations like the LGBTQ+ Alliance and the Humanities Association. I still enjoy de-stressing the way I did then, by mucking around with the code that powers my favorite games - both web-based and otherwise. It's a little embarrassing how long it took me to realize that might have been a sign that History was the wrong degree for me.</p>
            
                <p>I'm spending much of my time now formally learning the ins and outs of web development. I'm eager to work with current professionals or other learners to improve my skill and knowledge in working with various coding languages.

                <p><img src="images/sanefuldash.jpg" alt="Saneful 2020 Project Art"></p>
                <p>A fully functional arcade-style game built entirely in React. Work-from-home survival horror theme, with plans to continue expanding and adding features. Primary mechanic is a rock, paper, scissors balancing act between health, sanity, and money, with each deprecating over time and at an increasing rate as days go by. Full save system and leaderboard included.

                <p><img src="images/hozen.jpg" alt="Hozen Project Art"></p>
                <p>Wikket's Guide to Hozen is a spaced repetititon application implemented with Javascript. The app uses a singly linked list to cycle through questions, showing words that have been answered incorrectly more often than those answered correctly. The base language used is a silly send-up to World of Warcraft, featuring the Hozen.

                <p>Rollplay XP is a system for exchanging information between players of tabletop RPGs. One of the biggest impediments for new players is often the scale of the learning required for play, or difficulty in finding help in learning. Rollplay XP seeks to address that problem by introducing a system of topics and comments, allowing users to prompt discussions or ask questions and receive answers from their peers.
